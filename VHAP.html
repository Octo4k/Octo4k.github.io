                <p>Echoes of the Unshared
Kael woke up feeling wasted. That hum in his head the Collective thing that kept everyone in Eldenrich all synced and happy was there, sure, but something else sliced through it. A thought. His own gosh damn thought. It wasn’t floating around with everyone else’s like it should. It was sharp and kept muttering about some place out past the city’s edge. Forbidden, it said. What the hell did that even mean? He’d never heard that word before.
He sat up, heart banging against his ribs, hands sweaty. The pod he slept in was cold and stiff, and he hated it. Always had. He dragged himself to the mirror, feet thuding against the floor. Same old Kael stared back—blond hair a tangled mess down his back, those blue-tinted sunglasses with black frames he wore because why not. He rubbed his face, hoping the thought would Leave. It didn’t. It just got louder. Go look. Go see. Flashes hit him—red sky, rough ground, air that didn’t smell like the usual clean nothing. His gut twisted. He didn’t want to go anywhere. But his legs moved anyway. He yanked on his leather jacket—beat-up, scratched, the one thing that felt like his—and stumbled out. The city was too perfect, too quiet. People walked like robots, all in step, faces blank. Kael tried to keep up, but his feet kept tripping over themselves. He could feel the Collective poking at him, like a bunch of nosy neighbors peering through his skull. His chest tightened. He’d never been off-beat before. It sucked.
At the city’s edge, the dome loomed, all shiny and smug. That thought pushed him toward a rusty panel, showing him a crack. His fingers scraped at it, metal biting into his skin, and the panel popped open. Air rushed in—cold, dirty, alive. It hit his lungs hard, and he coughed, but it was... nice? He stepped out.
